# Hardware Development Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Uma Parvathi Mallissery Manyan** 👋  
I am a **Hardware / Electronics Engineer** with ~2 years of hands-on experience in the design, integration, and testing of space-grade electronic systems. My background spans power electronics, fault-tolerant hardware design, and multi-protocol communication interfaces, developed through a master’s specialization in Satellite Technology and applied project work at Fraunhofer EMI and multiple CubeSat missions.

I have experience taking hardware from requirements and architecture definition through schematic design, PCB layout, bring-up, debugging, and system-level validation. My master’s thesis at Fraunhofer EMI focused on designing a standardized interface module for integrating COTS processors into high-reliability onboard computers, including regulated power paths, MCU-based supervision, embedded FDIR concepts, and Ethernet/CAN-based communication. This work was presented at European Data Handling & Data Processing Conference (EDHPC) 2025 and accepted for publication in the IEEE proceedings.

Across projects, I work closely with systems, software, and test teams, and I am comfortable working hands-on with oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, and power analysis tools. I am motivated to work close to flight hardware in fast-paced aerospace and startup environments, contributing to reliable electronics that need to work the first time.
