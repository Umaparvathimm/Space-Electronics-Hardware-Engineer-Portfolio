# Venus Research Station – Conceptual Mission Design
**Julius-Maximilians University of Würzburg** · **04/2023 – 08/2023**

## Project Overview
The **Venus Research Station (VRS)** project was a large, interdisciplinary **conceptual mission study** conducted at the **University of Würzburg**.

The goal was to design a **long-duration atmospheric research station** operating within the Venusian atmosphere, supported by deployable scout probes, to address key open questions in Venus science, atmospheric dynamics, and planetary habitability.

The study followed **ECSS Phase 0 / early Phase A** methodology, covering mission definition, requirements analysis, subsystem design, trade studies, and system-level integration.  
The final report was **published in the university library** as a formal technical document.

## My Role & Contributions
I was responsible for **Requirements Analysis** and the **Power System subsystem**, working closely with mission, thermal, and system teams.

### Requirements Engineering
- Derived **user, mission, functional, and operational requirements** following ECSS principles
- Defined power-related boundary conditions based on:
  - Venus atmospheric environment
  - Mission phases and operational modes
- Supported system-level trade-offs impacting power generation, storage, and distribution

### Power System Design
- Developed the **end-to-end power architecture** for the Venus Research Station and scout vehicles
- Estimated subsystem power demands across mission phases
- Performed:
  - Power demand analysis
  - Energy storage sizing
  - Power generation trade-offs
- Contributed to **system-level power budgets** and margin analysis under extreme environmental constraints

## Project Scope & Disclaimer
This project represents a **conceptual academic study**.  
No flight hardware was built, and all designs remain at **system and subsystem concept level**.
