## Overview
This project involves the **hardware development of an Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) board** for a **12U CubeSat platform**, supporting precise attitude determination, control, and safe-mode operation for mission-critical spacecraft functions.

The AOCS electronics are designed to interface with a diverse set of **sensors and actuators**, enabling attitude estimation, closed-loop control, and fault-aware operation within strict **SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power)** constraints. The board forms a central element of the spacecraft’s control architecture and is designed for reliable operation in a space environment.

The work focuses on translating **system-level AOCS requirements** into robust, testable hardware, with careful consideration of power integrity, signal interfacing, fault containment, and subsystem integration.

## Scope of Work
- Hardware development for AOCS-related electronics within a 12U CubeSat platform
- Translation of system and mission requirements into hardware-level design decisions
- Definition of interfaces between AOCS electronics and other satellite subsystems
- Close collaboration with systems and software stakeholders

---

## Design Activities (High-Level)
- Schematic design and interface definition for AOCS electronics in **KiCad**
- Power distribution and signal interfacing considerations
- Design carried out with attention to **reliability, testability, and system integration**
- Early design reviews and iteration based on subsystem-level requirements

---

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- Hardware design and subsystem integration
- Requirements-driven schematic development
