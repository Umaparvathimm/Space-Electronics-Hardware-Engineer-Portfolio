# Forest Fire Detection Satellite
**Julius-Maximilians University of Würzburg** · **10/2022 – 02/2023**

---

## Project Overview
This project focused on the **design, assembly, and testing of a satellite demonstrator** aimed at simulating **early forest fire detection from space**.  

The mission concept addressed the growing impact of climate-driven forest fires by detecting thermal hot spots and transmitting alerts for rapid response.

The project followed a **system engineering approach**, covering mission definition, requirements analysis, subsystem design, integration, and full system testing on an air-bearing platform.
